# spacecraft frame: z is vertical
# z is in the vertical direction
# x is in vertical plane containing spacecraft velocity, in the direction of spacecraft motion
# y is vector product of z and x
# it is assumed that photoelectron sensor is pointed along the y-axis in the spacecraft frame, as sensor #1 on AE-E
# full angle of the field of view of the spacecraft photoelectron sensor (deg)
  20.0
# for plotting, length of line representing sensor's field of view axis (km)
  500.0
# for electron distribution over energy and pitch angle define below
# number of energy bins
   250
# size of energy bin (eV)
   1.0
# number of pitch angle bins (pitch angle varies between 0 and pi)
   59
# save the electron distribution over energy and pitch angle into a file for each orbit point (1/0 = Yes/No)

# number of energy-pitch angle ranges where particle fluxes will be calculated (<=20)
   10
# for each range give (in one line) minimal/ maximal energy (eV)
